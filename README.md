# Smart Shopping Trolley 🚛🛒

An innovative IoT-based solution that revolutionizes the retail shopping experience by eliminating long queues, enabling real-time expense tracking, and preventing theft using sensor automation.

## 💡 Project Overview

The **Smart Shopping Trolley** is a microcontroller-based system designed to enhance the in-store shopping experience. It combines **RFID** scanning, **laser-based anti-theft mechanisms**, a **real-time billing display**, and **Bluetooth connectivity** for mobile integration.

By automating the billing process and ensuring only scanned items are added to the cart, this system eliminates the need for traditional checkout counters, reduces human errors, and improves shopping efficiency.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 📲 **Automated Billing System** using RFID tags
- 🧮 **Real-Time Cost Display** on an LCD
- 🚨 **Anti-Theft System** with laser sensors and a buzzer alert
- 📱 **Bluetooth Connectivity** for optional mobile integration
- 🔋 **Battery Powered** for mobility and in-store flexibility
- 🧩 **Modular Design** suitable for future upgrades (touchscreen UI, cloud sync, payment integration)

## 🛠️ Hardware Components

- Arduino Uno
- RFID Reader (RC522)
- RFID Tags
- 16x2 LCD Display
- Laser Sensor and LDR
- Buzzer
- Bluetooth Module (HC-05)
- Rechargeable Battery

## 🔄 Working Principle

1. When a user scans a product's RFID tag, the Arduino reads the tag and displays item name and price.
2. The total is updated in real time and shown on the LCD.
3. If an item is added without scanning (detected via the laser sensor), the buzzer alerts the user.
4. Optionally, the bill can be synced to a mobile app via Bluetooth for contactless checkout.

## 📊 Results

- ⏱️ Reduced billing time by 60–70% compared to manual checkout.
- 📉 100% success rate in detecting unscanned items using laser-buzzer mechanism.
- 👍 Over 90% user satisfaction in pilot usability tests.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Cloud-based inventory and billing sync
- Secure payment integration (UPI/Wallets)
- Full-featured mobile application (React Native/Flutter)
- AI-based shopping recommendations
- Voice assistance and multilingual support
- Touchscreen upgrade and data analytics dashboard for retailers
